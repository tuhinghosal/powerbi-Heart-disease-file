Because these data were obtained through keggele, several data preparation processes were carried out. 
After that, real-world statistics were downloaded and logistic regression was run.
This model's accuracy is greater than 80%.Following logistic regression, the coefficient values are used to construct a model in powerbi.According to research,
females have a lower risk of developing heart disease than males.
The most essential factors are "CA value," "ex Ang Value," and "gender," with the coefficient value taken into account.
